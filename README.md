We've all had tasks that need to be done by a certain date and with somebody like me who forgets things, this tool will be useful for me to get to a better place with managing my tasks.

I am adding new functionality as this goes on and have listed them as issues so this is work in progress, as with anything that we build :)

To get started:
- Git clone the app into your local
- Install dependencies
```shell
 pip install -r requirements.txt
```
- Run the app locally
```shell
streamlit run app.py
```
